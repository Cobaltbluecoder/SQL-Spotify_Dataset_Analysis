Dataset:
The dataset features popular songs of 2023 on Spotify. It goes beyond typical datasets, offering insights into song attributes, popularity, and presence on music platforms. It includes details like track name, artist(s), release date, Spotify charts, streaming stats, and more.

Dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023

I've modified few of the column names in my dataset to make it easier to import into MySQL workbench.
